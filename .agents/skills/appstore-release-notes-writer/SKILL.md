# App Store Release Notes Writer

Write human-focused release notes, optionally localized to every existing metadata locale.

Use `appstore-metadata-sync` for general listing metadata edits, `appstore-metadata-localizer` for full listing translation, and `appstore-subscription-localizer` for subscription/IAP display-name localization.

## Preconditions

- Canonical metadata from `asc metadata pull --app "APP_ID" --version "1.2.3" --dir "./metadata"` or user-provided keywords.
- Auth configured for upload.
- Primary locale is `en-US` unless specified.
- Read `references/release_notes_guidelines.md`.
- Use highest semver under `metadata/version/`; locales are the JSON files there.

## Workflow

1. Gather input:
   - Git log: `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` then `git log <tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges`; remove merges/deps/CI/format noise.
   - User bullets or free text.
   - If absent, ask what changed.
2. Classify user-visible changes into `New`, `Improved`, `Fixed`; omit empty sections.
3. Draft primary locale notes:
   - lead with the clearest user-facing hook in the first ~170 chars;
   - describe user impact, not implementation;
   - use concrete action verbs;
   - naturally echo relevant local keywords from `metadata/version/<version>/<locale>.json` when present;
   - target 500-1500 chars, hard limit 4000.
4. If requested, draft `promotionalText` <= 170 chars.
5. Show draft with character count and wait for approval before localizing.
6. Localize approved notes:
   - formal/professional register and formal "you" where applicable;
   - adapt idioms and tone to local market;
   - echo locale-specific keywords naturally;
   - validate What's New <= 4000 and promo <= 170; shorten, never truncate mid-sentence.
7. Present a locale table with first 80 chars, counts, promo text/counts; wait for upload approval.
8. Upload:
   ```bash
   asc apps info edit --app "APP_ID" --version-id "VERSION_ID" --locale "en-US" --whats-new "..."
   asc metadata push --app "APP_ID" --version "1.2.3" --dir "./metadata" --dry-run
   asc metadata push --app "APP_ID" --version "1.2.3" --dir "./metadata"
   ```
   Include promo via `--promotional-text` or write `promotionalText` into canonical JSON before push.

## Paths

- Keywords/current notes: `metadata/version/{latest-version}/{locale}.json`
- Fields: `keywords`, `whatsNew`, optional `promotionalText`
- Canonical tree is shared with `asc metadata pull/push/keywords`.

## Rules

- What's New is not App Store search-indexed; write for conversion and clarity.
- Promotional text can update without a new submission.
- The visible 170-char preview matters most.
- On partial upload failure, report successes/failures and retry failed locales only.
- Use `appstore-metadata-localizer` for full listing translation and `appstore-aso-auditor` for keyword research.
