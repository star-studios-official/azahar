# Metadata And Compliance

Use this reference before submitting an app or responding to App Review.

## App Metadata Checklist

Verify these fields in App Store Connect:

- App name and subtitle
- Bundle ID and SKU
- Primary and secondary category
- Age rating
- Copyright
- Description
- Keywords
- Support URL
- Privacy Policy URL
- Marketing URL if used
- Release type, phased release, and manual/automatic release choice
- Pricing and availability
- Content rights
- App Review contact info
- Demo account or explanation that no account is required
- Review notes for paid features, test mode, subscription flow, or hardware requirements

## Privacy Policy

A Privacy Policy URL is required for App Store submission. It must be functional, public, and relevant to the app being submitted.

It should cover:

- App name and seller/legal entity.
- Contact email or postal contact.
- Data collected by the app.
- Data processed by backend services.
- Speech, audio, translation, analytics, crash logs, purchase, or account data if applicable.
- Data retention and deletion process.
- Third-party processors.
- Children's privacy if applicable.
- International data transfers if applicable.
- Effective date and update policy.

If drafting from another app's privacy policy, keep the relevant legal details but adapt data categories to the current app. Tell the user which facts still need legal owner confirmation.

## Terms Of Use / EULA

For auto-renewable subscriptions, App Review can block the submission if metadata lacks a functional Terms of Use or EULA link.

Use one of these approaches:

- Standard Apple EULA: include `https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/` in the app description or another metadata field accepted by Apple.
- Custom EULA: configure it in App Store Connect and link the public Terms page if the app has one.

The app description can include:

```text
Terms of Use: https://example.com/terms
Apple Standard EULA: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/
Privacy Policy: https://example.com/privacy
```

Verify each link with `curl` and a browser if App Review complained about it.

## Subscriptions

For auto-renewable subscriptions, verify:

- Product IDs match the app code.
- Group and products have localizations.
- Prices and territories are set.
- Subscription duration is correct.
- Introductory offer or trial is configured if advertised.
- Review screenshot is uploaded.
- Paywall clearly shows price, duration, trial details, renewal, cancellation, and links to Terms and Privacy.
- Metadata includes Terms/EULA.

If a product is not available in StoreKit sandbox, confirm App Store Connect state and allow for propagation delay.

## App Privacy Nutrition Label

The App Privacy answers must match the app and SDKs:

- Data used to track users.
- Data linked to the user.
- Data not linked to the user.
- Purpose for each data type.
- Whether data is collected by third-party SDKs.
- Whether IDFA is used.

If the API cannot set or verify all privacy answers, use App Store Connect web UI and record the final answers in the handoff.

## Encryption

If the app does not use non-exempt or proprietary encryption, set:

```text
ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false
```

Verify it in the archived app's `Info.plist`, not only in source:

```bash
plutil -p "$archive_path/Products/Applications/<App>.app/Info.plist" | rg ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption
```

If the app uses encryption beyond exempt HTTPS/system APIs, answer export compliance accurately in App Store Connect.

## Screenshots And Icons

Requirements change, so verify current App Store Connect requirements live.

General rules:

- App icon must be readable at small size and present in the asset catalog.
- Screenshots must match the actual app experience and device family.
- Required screenshot sets must be complete before review.
- Paywall and subscription screenshots should match current products and prices.
- Avoid screenshots that imply unsupported functionality.

For generated screenshots, keep the generator inputs, output paths, and upload evidence in the release handoff.

## Review Notes

Write review notes that reduce reviewer friction:

- Explain whether login is required.
- Explain demo/trial behavior and how to reach paid screens.
- Provide test credentials only if needed.
- Mention hardware, microphone, network, or real-time backend requirements if they affect testing.
- Avoid marketing copy; be operational.

## Legal URL Hosting

If hosting legal pages on the app backend:

- Deploy pages before submitting review.
- Verify `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/support` return 2xx without authentication.
- Prefer HTTPS.
- Keep content app-specific and current.
- Record deploy commit and HTTP verification in the handoff.
